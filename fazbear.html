    <h1>The "bite" of 87</h1>
    <p>Even though previously thought to be the cause of an animatronic called Freddy's machinery malfunctioning, <a href="bonnie.html">new footage shows otherwise</a> most of the image is redacted though :(</p>
    <p>It's believed that a worker's shotty repair work caused an animatronic's skeleton to essentially snap.</p>
    <p>The accident caused a young girl to be crushed and killed brutally under the weight of the animatronic.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p><b>Problem is,</b></p>
    <h2><b>THERE IS NO WAY FOR TITANIUM PARTS TO SNAP ON THEIR OWN!</b></h2>
    <h3>Fazbear's was run by Henry Emily and William Afton, who both were masters at their craft and worked on similar projects before.</h3>
    <h3>How can both of these borderline geniuses of engineering and design let this sort of thing happen?</h3>
    <h2><i>and that's where the conspiracy comes in</i></h2>
    <h2>William Afton was accused of a series of murders in animatronic restaurants a few years after the events at Fazbear's. </h2>
    <h3>Now we at Utah murder mystery club believe that William Afton had a hand in what happened at Fazbear's, but we are of course making no legally binding allegations.</h3>
    <h3>Since Henry and William worked hand in hand however, we cannot help but wonder if he also was involved somehow.</h3>
    <h3><i>A partner blinded by money</i></h3>
